          <h3>Aspirare alpha</h3>
          <p>
            Aspirare Alpha is the first generation of the Aspirare AI
            accelerator family, and is based on our innovative architecture
            using a mature technology node. It aims to double the throughput
            compared to Nvidia A100, while consuming a fraction of power and a
            lower cost. With our technology, our customers are able to reduce
            infrastructure costs and operating costs by 4X and 8X respectively
            with same throughput. Our Alpha chip offers calculations at 8-bit
            accuracy. This corresponds to 648 TOPS, which is equivalent to 2X of
            the throughput of the A100 on a single chip, with the option of
            multiple chips that can be put in parallel to further increase the
            throughput. The maximum bandwidth that can be achieved is 1.44Tb/s
            per chip, which is comparable to the A100.

          <h3>Aspirare beta</h3>
          <p>
            Aspirare Beta is the second generation of the Aspirare AI
            accelerator family, and is based on our innovative architecture
            using a mature FinFet technology node. Compared to the Alpha, the
            throughput has been increased by 5X, while the power has been
            reduced by 1.6X. Compared to Nvidia A100, the throughput has been
            increased by 10X, while the power has been reduced by 6X. Compared
            to Nvidia H100 PCIe, the throughput is slight higher, while the
            power has been reduced by 6X. Our Beta chip offers calculations at
            8-bit accuracy. This corresponds to 3200 TOPS, which is equivalent
            to 5X of the throughput of the A100 on a single chip, with the
            option of multiple chips that can be put in parallel to further
            increase the throughput. The maximum bandwidth that can be achieved
            is 3.2Tb/s per chip, which is 2.13X greater than the A100, and 1.6X
            greater than the H100.

        <h2>About</h2><p>
          AI is the Future and it is Advancing Fast. Though early stages, we can
          already see a large impact of AI/ML on various industries and sectors,
          powered by DALLE2, ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft M365 and many
          similar products. AI/ML workloads are computationally heavy (requiring
          high power consumption) and are increasing exponentially. Computations
          for large AI/ML models are currently done predominately in Data
          Centers. Power consumption has a high negative impact on the planet.
